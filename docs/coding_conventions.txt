Coding is mainly done in C and ASM when needed.

For developing purposes the user could choose the IDE he/she wants, the files will be compiled with batch scripts for the main platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac)

 

In order to make the code more clear we will use this conventions.

- Types should be lowercase

#define mytype char
- Constants uppercase

#define PIN2   2
- Macros are written also in uppercase

#define MAX(a, b) (((a) > (b)) ? (a) : (b))
- Variables:

local ones would start with lowercase

int my_local_variable;
global ones would start with uppercase

int My_global_variable;
- Functions CamelCase starting with uppercase letter

void StartEngine(int value);
Openning curly bracket used for functions and blocks should be located at the end of the starting block line

  void Function(void) {
     code;
}
Code should be untabified with four spaces for each tab.

Modules should incorporate a comment field with the following information:

- Date and author(s)

- Main purpose of the module

- TODO list and bugs found

- Any notes of interest
